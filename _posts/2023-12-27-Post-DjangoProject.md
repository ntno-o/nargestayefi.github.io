# How My Django Porject Went:

## STEP1

thinking of an idea about what we can do with django according to our current knowledge
<br>
my idea then was a website in which sellers can submit data about their stores like name, type of the store, address, telephone number, and finally opening/closing hours;
and purchasers can search whether a store is open at a specific time of the day. 
<br>

## STEP2

now I have to display THE idea in a visual form.
starting with coding simple HtML and getting help from <a href="http://www.w3schools.com"> w3schools </a> to make the pages look a bit professional in design.
<br>

## STEP3

the TOUGH part has started.
I have to start a django webapp and combine the HTMLs whit Django.
I had to review the django tutorials and figure out where to start and what to do. 
fortunately with the help of our TAs i could appriciate a bit more of django and its syntaxes.
<br>


## STEP4

with the help of AI moreoften <a href="http://www.blackbox.ai">blackbox</a> which is an AI for the only use of coding which didn't require any VPN.
gradually after some sleepless nights I could make something little.
understanding Models, Forms. Views, Urls and so on.
for example a challenge we've been through was that we all had trouble with seting images in webapp , but at last we found out with creating a 'static' directory in '(myappname)' directory in which we create another folder called 'images' and put the images there to link them with the django. the important part was that we had to import it to settings and add some lines of code so we can see the images in the application.
<br>

## STEP5

deploying the django project on <a href="http://www.pythonanywhere.com"> pythonanywhere.com </a>in which we had signed up before. 


## STEP6

be ready for presentation
